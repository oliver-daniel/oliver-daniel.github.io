                        <p>Our team was tasked with discovering a problem and a target demographic for a user-focused
                            design prototype. This case study provides an overhead view of the five projects that guided
                            us through the <strong>double-diamond model</strong> of UX research, and which led to the
                            creation of our interactive prototype. At the end of this page, you'll see the finished
                            prototype for <strong>Studdi Buddi</strong>: a mobile application that helps U of T St.

                    As our group formed and began preliminary discussions, we realized that all but one of us were new
                    to the St. George campus in some way.
                    Although pandemic-related frustrations entering and exiting Robarts often meant it was simplest to
                    remain inside Bissell to study, we
                    found ourselves wanting a change of scenery. But, we were left with the question so many of our
                    peers,
                    even those with experience on-campus, had asked before us: <em>where should I go?</em> And, even
                    once you know where to go,
                    how can you be sure that you won't run into capacity limits once you get there?
                <div style="height: 80px;"></div>
                <p>
                    In this project, we conducted preliminary research into our target demographic – UTSG students– and
                    how their studying is affected by their surroundings. We did this by conducting <strong>field
                        observations</strong> and an anonymous
                    <strong>survey</strong> focused on personal environmental preferences, both of which which turned
                    out to provide
                    data that was a
                    little too general to extrapolate from.
                    We also conducted
                    <strong>secondary research</strong>
                    by way of analyzing scholarly texts. The articles we found the most useful discussed the mental
                    models people create when
                    discovering and navigating around new places.

                            With our data in hand, this project set us out on the laborious journey of interpreting it
                            to derive tangible, meaningful conclusions about our target demographic. After making a few
                            notational decisions about how scale-based questions ought to be evaluated numerically, we
                            came
                            out with a full table of respondent data and our expected averages. Our qualitative data,
                            meanwhile,
                            was recorded into a <strong>affinity diagram</strong>, which we drafted
                            using <strong>MURAL</strong> to simulate the in-person experience of sticking Post-It notes
                            to a board.

                        with a number of factors preventing him from studying at home. Building a solid model of Ezra's
                        attitudes and behaviour
                        in an <strong>Empathy Map</strong>,
                        and his current situation in a <strong>As-Is Scenario</strong>,
                        provided
                        a strong sense of narrative to later projects.

                    This project finally allowed us to get creative and explore the possibilities of what
                    our solution ought to do. Although everyone in the group naturally gravitated toward the idea of a
                    mobile
                    application, we had to keep our minds open and put out any ideas we thought of, even the more
                    <strong>absurd</strong>
                    ones, in the hopes of finding that perfect 'high impact, high feasibility' combo of the No Brainer.
                    For this reason, keeping Ezra in mind became a priority from this assignment onward.

                The Ideation phase was informative for many reasons, but I find it exemplififes the importance of
                <strong>the art of compromise</strong> in group work,
                especially when everyone has to combine their varying opinions into a singular finished assignment or
                prototype. I was fortunate enough to be working with a team
                with excellent communication and compassion, so we were able to rapidly come to a compromise on
                disagreements.

                    After letting our imaginations run wild, it was time to converge all of our
                    ideas into a series of singular prototypes: one <strong>low-fi</strong> prototype on paper, and
                    one <strong>medium-fi</strong> version, made interactive using <strong>Balsamiq</strong>.
                    In order to make sure that our prototypes lined up with our <strong>To-Be Scenario</strong>
                    and our <strong>business outcome hypotheses</strong>, we ran an array of <strong>lean usability
                        tests</strong>
                    with our peers. These involved observing testers as they attempted to accomplish a series of tasks
                    inside the app, ranging from logging in to reporting a maintenance issue they discover inside a
                    library.
                    With the low-fi prototype, this also involved <strong>Wizard-of-Oz</strong> testing, in which a
                    human
                    served as the computer and guided testers from screen to screen based on verbal and gestural
                    'input'.

                Watching someone else use your product, with limited or no ability to instruct or help them,
                is a feeling I'm not sure a designer ever gets used to; but, these <strong>formative
                    evaluations</strong>
                provided us with some of the most meaningful feedback we had received so far. I placed the
                low-fi <strong>storyboard</strong> behind this video of our mid-fi prototype in action,
                to represent how the prior served as a bedrock foundation for the latter.

                        assignment, I had the chance to look backward
                        at the fruits of our labour, at the end of a semester of unique challenges and struggles. Below,

                        ...Just kidding. In all seriousness, this project was a fascinating and educational foray into
                        UX
                        research and design, as well as in long-term group collaboration. By the final assignment,
                        we were working so efficiently, dividing tasks and taking breaks to review one another's work,
                        that we were able to wrap up in just one two-hour Zoom call.</p>
                    <p>As we noted in the Evolution
                        assignment
                        proper, the one change we would make if we were given the chance to begin anew, would be to
                        structure
                        our primary data-gathering techniques in the Discovery assignment in a more purposeful way.
                        Especially with the
                        rigours of the Interpretation assignment, having a more focused set of data would have made
                        drawing
                        meaningful conclusions much easier and less labour intensive, rather than requiring a custom
                        <strong>Python</strong> script to calculate average survey results.

                    <p>I am interminably grateful to my team, each of whom employed their unique skills and personality
                        to the fullest extent to keep us organized, motivated, and submitting high-quality assignments
                        on time. If you're reading this, thank you!</p>
                    <p>In either case, I also want to extend a huge <strong>thank you</strong> to Prof. St.-Cyr, who not
                        only provided ongoing feedback and accommodations when we needed them, but also led us through
                        the entire course project one lecture and studio at a time.</p>
