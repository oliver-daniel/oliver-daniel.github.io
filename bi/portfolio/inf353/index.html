                <h2 class="subheader">A suite of applications helping Ontarians manage their COVID-19 vaccinations.</h2>
                <p>The early days of the pandemic in Ontario were filled with confusion and frustration, as residents
                    struggled
                    to find vaccination sites and book appointments to receive their first dose.
                    Even later on, the process of acquiring and presenting proof of vaccination remained unintuitive and
                    difficult,
                    until the practice was dropped altogether.
                </p>
                <p>Could using Human-Centred Design have provided a better way?</p>

                <p>A user persona is a crucial element of Human-Centred Design: by envisioning who you're designing for,
                    you gain a more holistic understanding of what features are more or less essential to helping your
                    users achieve their goals.</p>
                <p>This exercise led to a surprising lesson: <em>design is time-sensitive.</em> March 2022 saw the end
                    of many pandemic-related restrictions of Ontario, which forced me to examine how an application to
                    help Ontarians receive and prove vaccinations could still be helpful.</p>

                <p>I've always struggled to draw on paper, especially when precision is an asset. For low-fidelity
                    prototyping of screens for both platforms, I used a stylus to draw directly in Figma using the
                    Pencil tool. This allowed me to combine the flexibility and speed of hand-drawing with the
                    convenience of undo, redo, and copying shared components.</p>
                <p>Although I had some previous experience designing for Android mobile phones, smartwatches were a
                    completely new realm. I relied heavily on official Wear OS style guides to determine what components

        <li><span>Lessons learned:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Design is time-sensitive: the assignment was released after the Government of Ontario had lifted most vaccine mandates, which made creating a user persona more difficult – who wants a vaccine but still hasn't gotten one? Would having a mobile/smartwatch application really make that process more convenient?</li>
                <li>Working on major UX projects alone has benefits and drawbacks. You have full control over the project and your mental image is the single source of truth, but you have to do <em>everything</em> yourself: there's no delegation, and no second opinions from someone equally informed on the confines of the project.</li>
                <li>Limitations on tools are limitations on possibilities. Figma doesn't currently have very robust systems for handling interactions, in particular reactive design. There's no way to set variables, etc. using just prototyping features, so every possible state has to either be accounted for or forced away ('happy path'). Similarly, including even simple animations proved to be a pain; the best solution ended up being to *produce a GIF* of the desired animation, and include it as an image in the prototype. Including these workarounds was a *major* point of friction, especially when working alone.</li>
                <li>Despite having purchased a touchscreen-enabled laptop over the pandemic, this was my first time using that feature for creative work.Figma's Pencil tool is simple, but robust enough for drawing low-fidelity prototypes with a stylus, especially with a keyboard close at hand to enter shortcuts and the like. (Working on my stylus handwriting is a future goal.)</li>
